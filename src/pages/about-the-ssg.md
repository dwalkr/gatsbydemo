Gatsby is a static site generator built on the React JavaScript framework. Gatsby's purpose is to build fast, highly-optimized static sites.

One of Gatsby's biggest strengths is its ability to ingest data from multiple sources — files, databases, or APIs — and create pages from them during its build step.
